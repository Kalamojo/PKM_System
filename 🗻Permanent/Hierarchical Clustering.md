# Hierarchical Clustering

```ad-note
Given a distance (or similarity) matrix for one attribute of some datapoints, Hierarchical clustering produces a tree representing a family of clusters.
The size of these clusters can then be decided by the user.
```

```ad-example
![[Hierarchical Clustering 2022-03-24 21.43.15.excalidraw 1|600]]
```
