# Weighted Sum Calculation



>Takes the sum of all input values multiplied by their respective weights.

## Equation 1
To calculate the weigted sum of a [[Perceptron|Perceptron's]] inputs, the values of the inputs and their [[Weight|Weights]] are needed. There are multiple way to depict the equation. This is one example: 
> ## $$\sum^j_{i=0} w_ix_i$$

## Equation 2
The equation can also be depicted as the dot product of the weight and value vectors:
> ## $$w * x$$
