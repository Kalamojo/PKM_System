> [!note]
> Neurons, in the most basic sense, are information messengers. In the brain, they communicate with various areas by using electrical impulses and chemical signals, creating [[Neural Network|Neural Networks]] or [[Neural Layer|Neural Layers]].

> [!example]
> There are two major types of artificial neurons: the [[Perceptron]] and the [[Sigmoid]] neutron.
