# Trie

>[!note]
> A Trie is a data structure designated for strings specifically. Each node denotes a letter, and traversing from one node to another represents adding the next character of a string.

> [!info]
> They are often used for dictionary searching applications, and often have a constant runtime due to the constraint of how long a word can be.

> [!example]
> Words in the Dictionary:
> - bats
> - bad
> - cat
> - cats
> - cool
> - bath
