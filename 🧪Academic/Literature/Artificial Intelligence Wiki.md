# Artificial Intelligence Wiki

- Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.
- Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real world facts. A representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.
- Natural language processing (NLP) allows machines to read and understand human language.
- Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition, facial recognition, and object recognition. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.
- A machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with a breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.
