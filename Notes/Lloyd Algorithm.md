# Lloyd Algorithm


> [!note]
> K-means clustering algorithm that involves changing all points at once to match centroids.

> [!info]
> > 1. Arbitrarily assign k centroids.
> > 2. While cluster centers keep changing:
> 	> 1. Assign each datapoint to nearest centroid.
> 	> 2. After assignment of all datapoints, computer new centroids according to the center of gravity of each existing cluster (the average of the points).
