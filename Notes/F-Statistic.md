# F-Statistic

> [!note]
> If an F-value from an ANOVA test is greater than a critical F value, then the null hypothesis can be rejected. 

> [!info]
> The critical F-value can be calculated given a critical value $\alpha$, the numerator degrees of freedom (for between groups), and the denominator degrees of freedom (for within groups).
