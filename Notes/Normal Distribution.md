# Normal Distribution

> [!note]
> Also known as Gaussian Distribution or the Bell Curve.
> Normal Distributions are always centered around the average value. The width of the curve is the Standard Deviation and the peak of the curve is the mode of the population.

> [!example]
> Imagine you have a dice with varying probabilities of rolling certain values.

> Out of the vast population of infinite dice rolls, you have a population mean of $\mu$. One way you can estimate this population mean is by obtaining sample means.
> Instead of simply taking one sample of dice rolls, like for instance: [1, 2, 6, 1], you can instead take samples of samples of dice rolling. For example, you could record these dice rolls for various sample:
> >$S_1 = [1, 4, 6, 5], S_2 = [2, 6, 6, 1], ... S_n = [...]$
> 
> After doing this many times, the closer to infinity the better, you find that the means of these samples follow a certain pattern.
