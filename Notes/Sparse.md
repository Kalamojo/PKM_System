# Sparse Representation


> [!note]
> Sparse representations of [[Data]] are useful for [[Notes/Machine Learning]] procesees. This is a situation in which most values in a set are 0, while a few values actually filled. The 0s are not actually stored during operations.

> [!info] 
> Allows high-dimensional data to still be manipulated and stored, since only a finite amount of values are used at a given time
> Sparse representation is like the opposite of [[Dense]] representation
