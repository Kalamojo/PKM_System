# Discretization

> [!note]
> Discretization, also called binning, converts numerical attributes into categorical ones. This is done by seperating the data into intervals and then naming those intervals.

> [!example]
> - Age distribution: {"Ones": 0-9, "Tens": 10-19, "Twenties: 20-29"}
> - Population Wealth percentage distribution: {"Middle 20% of Wealth": 4%, "Upper-Middle 20% of Population": 11%, "Top 20% of Population": 85%}
