# Expected Value $E[X]$

>[!note]
> The expected value of a random variable $X$ is the [[Weighted Sum]] of each possible value.

>[!math]
> In Probability, it would be calculated as such:
> $$E[X] = \sum^k_{i=1} x_ip_i$$

>[!example]
> Each possible value is multiplied by its respective probability of occuring. 
> Here is an example with dice rolling:
> $$\sum 1*\frac{1}{6} + 2*\frac{1}{6} + 3*\frac{1}{6} + 4*\frac{1}{6} + 5*\frac{1}{6} + 6*\frac{1}{6}$$
> $$E[X] = 3.5$$
