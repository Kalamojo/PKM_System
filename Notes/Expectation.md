# Expected Value $E[X]$

```ad-note
The expected value of a random variable $X$ is the [[Weighted sum]] of each possible value.
```
```ad-math
In Probability, it would be calculated as such:
$$E[X] = \sum^k_{i=1} x_ip_i$$
```
```ad-example
Each possible value is multiplied by its respective probability of occuring. 
Here is an example with dice rolling:
>$$\sum 1*\frac{1}{6} + 2*\frac{1}{6} + 3*\frac{1}{6} + 4*\frac{1}{6} + 5*\frac{1}{6} + 6*\frac{1}{6}$$
>$$E[X] = 3.5$$
