```ad-note
A standard way to measure similarity between two variables. It taskes the size of the intersection of the two variables divided by the size of the union of the variables.
For binary outputs, it takes the number of attributes where both A and B are 1 divided by the number of times A and B are different or the same (10 + 01 +11).
```

```ad-math
$$J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$$
```
