# Jaccard Index

> [!note]
> A standard way to measure similarity between two variables. It taskes the size of the intersection of the two variables divided by the size of the union of the variables.
> For binary outputs, it takes the number of attributes where both A and B are 1 divided by the number of times A and B are different or the same (10 + 01 +11).

> [!math]
> $J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}$
