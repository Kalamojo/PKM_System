# Discrete Random Variable

A random variable that takes on only a finite or countably infinite number of values.

>Define random variable A, denoting long sepal length (7cm or more) as follow:
> $$A(v) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } v < 7 \\ 1 & \text{if } v \geq 7 \end{cases}$$
>The sample space of A is $O$ = [4.3, 7.9], and its range is {0, 1}. Thus, A is discrete.
