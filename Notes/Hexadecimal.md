>[!note]
> The hexadecimal number system is base 16. Numbers range from 1 to F.

> [!info]
> For an 4 digit number:
> 
> $$d_{3}*16^{3} + d_{2}*16^{2} + d_{1}*16^{1} + d_{0}*16^{0} = \text{value}$$
> With each value being multiplied by these powers
> 
> Also, each Hexadecimal digit represents 4 binary bits

> [!example]
> $${3A}_{16} = {58}_{10}$$
> 
> $${E7}_{16} = {1110 \enspace 0111}_2$$
