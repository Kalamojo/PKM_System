# Weighted Sum Calculation


> [!note]
> Takes the sum of all input values multiplied by their respective weights.

> [!math]
> To calculate the weigted sum of a [[Perceptron|Perceptron's]] inputs, the values of the inputs and their [[Weights]] are needed. There are multiple way to depict the equation. This is one example: 
> $$\sum^j_{i=0} w_ix_i$$

> [!math]
> The equation can also be depicted as the dot product of the weight and value vectors:
> $$w * x$$
