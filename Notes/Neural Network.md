# Neural Networks


> [!note]
> Complex groups of connected artificial [[Neurons]] that work together to make decisions and draw conclusions. A [[Neural Layer|layer of neurons]] is a function, while a neural network is a function of functions.

> [!info]
> They are based, or at least originate from, the way real brains and neurons work. The core principal behind them is finding patterns. The basic units of neural networks are [[Neurons]]. Neurons hold a value from 0 to 1, and are used to represent the degree to which a certain quality is true.

> *Suppose the weekend is coming up, and you've heard that there's going to be a cheese festival in your city. You like cheese, and are trying to decide whether or not to go to the festival. You might make your decision by weighing up three factors:*

> > 2. Does your boyfriend or girlfriend want to accompany you?
> > 3. Is the festival near public transit? (You don't own a car).

> *We can represent these three factors by corresponding binary variables $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. For instance, we'd have $x_1$ = 1 if the weather is good, and $x_1$ = 0 if the weather is bad. Similarly, $x_2$ = 1 if your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to go, and $x_2$ = 0 if not. And similarly again for $x_3$ and public transit.*

They work by using [[Neural Layer|layers of neurons]] and connecting them together. In most models, there is an input layer (depicted by blue), hidden layers (depicted in black), and output layers (the green ones).
