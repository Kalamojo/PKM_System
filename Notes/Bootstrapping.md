# Bootstrapping


> [!note]
> An manual method of calculating the confidence interval of a distribution. 

> [!info]
> Steps:
> 1. Randomly select a number of data points and take the mean of the sample.
> 2. Plot the sample mean on a number line.
> 3. Repeat the process many times (usually more than 10,000 times)
> 4. Report the interval of values that covers a percentage of the sample means.

> [!tip] 
> If you report the interval that covers 95% of the means, this should be roughly equivalent to the 95% confidence interval of the distribution. Anything outside of the confidence interval occurs less than 5% of the time.
