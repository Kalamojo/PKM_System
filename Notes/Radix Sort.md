# Radix Sort

>[!note]
> A non-comparative sorting algorithm that works by placing elements into buckets based on their least significant digit, then the next least significant digit, and the next. At the end of this process, each item is in sorted order without any comparison.

>[!info]
>One disadvantage of Radix Sort, as opposed to comparison-based sorting algorithms, is that it requires each item to have definitive "digits" or characters, whereas comparison-based sorting algorithms only need comparable items.
