# Bias


> [!note]
>The ability of a machine learning model to capture the relationship between inputs and outputs.

> [!info] 
> The bias of a [[Perceptron]] is equivalent to the negative of its threshold. It is a measure of how easy it is to get the perceptron to output a 1, or in other terms, to _fire_.

> [!example] 
| ![[Bias 2022-03-30 19.43.44.excalidraw]] | ![[Bias 2022-03-30 20.08.03.excalidraw]] |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| High Bias                                     | Low Bias                                      |
