# Single Sample t-test

```ad-note
Is used to answer the question of, "How different are the two distributions some samples came from?" Tests whether the mean of a population is different from a certain value.
```

```ad-math
$$\mathrm{t}=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{\sigma_{x} / \sqrt{(n)}}$$
$\bar{x} = \text{sample mean}$
$\sigma=\text{sample standard deviation}$
$n = \text{sample size}$
$\mu_0 = \text{hypothesized population mean}$
```
