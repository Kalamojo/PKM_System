# Principle of Duality


```ad-note
For a Boolean expression, its dual expression can be obtained by interchanging the OR and AND operations and replacing the constants 0 and 1 by 1 and 0 respectively.
```
```ad-info
- $1 * 0 = 0 --> 0 + 1 = 1$
- $0 * 0 = 0 --> 1 + 1 = 1$

Any two statements that have this property are called dual
```
