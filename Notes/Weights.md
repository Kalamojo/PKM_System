# Weights

```ad-note
The parameters of a Machine Learning model. They are a set of numbers embedded into a model to help predict correct output values.

>[!example]
> There may be a situation in which a person wants to decide whether they will apply for a scholarhip. There are 3 different factors:
> 1. Is it more than $500
> 2. If there is an Essay or not
> 3. Is it due within the next week
> 
> While each of these inputs matter in determining if the person should apply for the scholarship or not, some inputs may have more weight than others. Maybe this individual really hates writing essays, so factor 2 may have a weight of 10. The other two inputs, 1 and 3, can have less weights, like 2 for each. If there is a threshold or [[Bias]] of 5, factor number 2 is really the only deciding factor.
