# Decision Tree

> [!note]
> A [[Machine Learning]] [[Algorithm]] in which inputs are passed through a stream of gates, and the probability that a condition is met depends on those gates and what they decide

> [!example]
> If a patient has high blood pressure, is over 60, has had a history of sickness, and is overweight, then they may have a 90% likelihood of returning to the hospital. On the other hand, if they patient has all those same conditions, but they are not overweight, they may have a 70% likelihood of returning
> In the same situation, if the patient has standard blood pressure, a different condition may be checked. This would be a different path than the earlier examples
