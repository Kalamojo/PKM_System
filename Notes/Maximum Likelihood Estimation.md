# Maximum Likelihood Estimation


```ad-note
The goal of Maximum Likelihood Estimation is to fit a distribution to a dataset. This is done by choosing parameters that maximise the likelihood of producing values in the dataset.
```

```ad-question
- What binomial distribution gives the highest probability that the situation present in the dataset occurs?
- What mean and standard deviation will create the normal distribution that most closely matches the dataset?
```
