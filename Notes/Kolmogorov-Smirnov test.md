# Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

```ad-note
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test is used to determine if:
- $H_0:$ a sample comes from distribution $P$
against
- $H_1:$ the sample does not come from distribution $P$

It can be used to assess how "different" two empirical distributions are.
```

```ad-math
$$D_{n}=\max _{x}\left|F_{\exp }(x)-F_{\text {obs }}(x)\right|$$
$F_{\exp }(x)=$ Cumulative Distribution Function (of hypothesized distribution)
$F_{\text {obs }}(x)=$ Empirical Distribution Function
```
