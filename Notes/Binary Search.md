# Binary Search

>[!note]
> A search algorithm uses properties of sorted lists to efficiently eliminate items to search through. It first looks at the center element, and then given it's comparison to the target value, only searches through half of the remaining items.

> [!info]
> While this algorithm is much faster than a basic linear search, it requires the items in the list to be in sorted order.
