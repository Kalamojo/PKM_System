# Ray Tracing Acceleration

>[!note]
> Methods to achieve sub-linear time complexities for tracing a given ray, namely by utilizing spatial [[Data Structures]] to avoid checking every single [[Triangle Mesh|triangle]] in a scene for [[Intersection|intersections]].

> [!example]
> There are two types of Acceleration structures:
> 1. [[Object Subdivision]]
> 2. [[Spatial Subdivision]]
