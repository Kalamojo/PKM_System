# Parametric Surfaces

>[!note]
> Also known as Boundary representations. They represent solids as a collection of connected surface elements, defining the boundary between solid and non-solid (inner and outer points).

> [!math]
> Their graphs are typically [[Function|functions]] with the two [[Weights|Parameters]] $u,v$, used to calculate points like so:
> $$x=f(u,v)$$
> $$y=g(u,v)$$
> $$z=h(u,v)$$
> for point on surface $\boldsymbol{p}=(x,y,z)$
