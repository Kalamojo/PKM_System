# Deep Learning

```ad-note
A [[Machine Learning]] method based on artificial [[Neural Network|Neural Networks]] with [[Representation Learning]]. Also known as Deep Neural Networks, it is basically a huge pile of equations that can help obtain useful answers.

> [!example] 
> Its procesees can be likened to a toddler that can't swim. Instead of showing the toddler many different techniques and/or demonstrations of swimming, a Deep Learning model might drop that toddler into the pool, forcing them to figure out how to achieve their main objective: swimming.

> This allows much more complex tasks to be completed, such as winning a game of chess or checkers. A goal is defined, and it is up to the model to decide which is the best way to achieve it. This is made possible by a [[Neural Network]], which uses nodes to process things.
Deep Learning is particularly effective for making predictions from [[Big Data]], and it is considered a sub-field of [[Notes/Data Science|Data Science]].
