# Binomial Distribution

> [!note]
> Similar to Bernoulli distribution but involves running multiple trials, which are independant of each other. Order does not matter, but different combinations do.

> [!example] 
> I flipped a coin 5 times. 3 times it was heads, and twice it was tails. Tails was considered a success, so the probability of success ($p$) is 0.2.
