# Balls-In-Bins


> [!note]
> There are ${n+b-1}\choose{b-1}$ ways to put $n$ indistinguishable balls into $b$ different bins.

> [!example] 
> How many solutions to $x + y + z = 10?$
> Possibilities:
> - $x=3, y=4, z=3$
> - $x=0, y=6, z=4$
> - $x=7, y=1, z=2$
> There are ${10+3-1}\choose{3-1}$ solutions to $x + y + z = 10$
