# The Sum Rule


> [!info]
> For two tasks A and B:
> If A can be done in ==m== ways, and B can be done in ==n== ways, then A and B can be done in ==m + n== ways.

> [!example] 
> How many ways are there to choose a drink?
> - Hot drinks: Cofee, Tea
> - Cold drinks: Juice, Soda, Ice water
> - Room temparature: Water
> 
> Number of combinations: Hot + Cold + Room temparature = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
