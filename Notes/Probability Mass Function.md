# Probability Mass Function


```ad-note
A function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
```

```ad-math
$$f(x)=P(X=x) \quad \text{for all } x \epsilon \mathbb{R}$$
$f$ obeys the basic rules of probability, such that it is non-negative and the sum of all probabilities adds up to 1.
$$\sum_x f(x) = 1$$
```

```ad-example
The probability that you get a 5 when rolling a die:
$$f(5) = P(X = 5) = \frac{1}{6} = 0.1667 = p$$
```
