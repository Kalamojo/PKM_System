# Sample Standard Deviation

> [!note]
> The average distance of observed values from the expected values. Also calculated as the square root of the sample variance.

> [!math]
> $$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}{N-1}}$$
> $N = \text{sample size}$
> $x_i = \text{value of sample item}$
> $\bar{x} = \text{sample mean}$
