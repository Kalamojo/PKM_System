# Heuristic

>A Heuristic is a sort of shortcut used to improve the speed of problem solving, but at the cost of optimality, completeness, precision, or accuracy.

Instead, the [[Greedy Algorithm]] can be used to give a good but not optimal solution (it is an approximation to the optimal answer) in a reasonably short amount of time. The greedy algorithm heuristic says to pick whatever is currently the best next step regardless of whether that prevents (or even makes impossible) good steps later. It is a heuristic in that practice says it is a good enough solution, theory says there are better solutions (and even can tell how much better in some cases).
