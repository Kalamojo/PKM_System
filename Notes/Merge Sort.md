# Merge Sort

> [!info]
> Time Complexity: O(nlog(n))

> [!note]
> Works by splitting list into half repeatedly untile sizes of 1 are achieved. Then sub-arrays are combined in a sorted way.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int merge(int* arr) {
	cout << "Bro";
}

int main() {
	int arr[5] = {1, 5, 2, -32, 4};
	merge(arr);
	return 0;
}
