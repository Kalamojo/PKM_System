# Confidence Interval

> [!note]
> Represents how much uncertainty there is with a given statistic. Tells you how confident you can be that the statistic accurately represents the actual population.
> Is generally more informative than the p-value as it can be used to find the p-value, but not the other way around.

> [!quote] 
> "A range of plausible values for a population parameter with a certain level of confidence."

```ad-math
 $$X \pm Z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
 - $X=$ value that the confidence interval is being computed for
 - $Z=$ z value for the desired confidence interval
 - $s=$ standard deviation of the sample
 - $n=$ sample size
```
