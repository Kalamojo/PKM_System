# Pointer

> [!note]
> A pointer is essentially a memory address that can be assigned a value. They can refrence existing data without cloning or copying the data.

> [!example]
> ```cpp
> int *iPtr; // a pointer to an integer value
> double *dPtr; // a pointer to a double value
> 
> int x = 5;
> iPtr = &x; //initialize pointer with address variable value
