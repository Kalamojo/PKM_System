# The Product Rule


> [!info]
> For subsequent (done right after each other) tasks A and B:
> If A can be done in ==m== ways, and B can be done in ==n== ways, then A and B can be done in ==mn== ways.

> [!example] 
> How many breakfast combinations are there?
> - Drinks: coffee, juice, tea
> - Break: wheat, white, rye, muffin
> - Main: pancake, omlette
> - Side: bacon, ham, hashbrown
> 
> Number of combinations: Drinks \* Break \* Main \* Side = 3 \* 4 \* 2 \* 3 = 72
