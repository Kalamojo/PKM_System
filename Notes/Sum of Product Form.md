# Sum of Product Form


```ad-note
An output function or circuit can be expressed as a sum of minterms. The minterms that make up the equation depend on the truth table of the function, specifically at the positions where f (the output) = 1.
```
```ad-example
SOP($x_1+x_2$) = $x_1'x_2 + x_1x_2'+x_1x_2$
```
