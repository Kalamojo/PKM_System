# Two Sample t-test

```ad-note
Is used to answer the question of, "How different are the two distributions some samples came from?" The two-sample t-test tests whether the means of two populations are different.
```

```ad-math
$\begin{align}t=\frac{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}{\sigma_{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}} && \sigma_{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}\end{align}$
$\bar{x} = \text{sample mean}$
$\sigma=\text{sample standard deviation}$
$n = \text{sample size}$
```
