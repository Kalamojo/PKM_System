Gaussian processes are exceedingly popular in areas like [[Geostatistics]] and Finance.

## Representation
For any set $S_1$, a Gaussian Process (GP) on $S$ is a set of random variables ($Z_t: t\epsilon S$) such that:
> For any $n$ value, and for any $t_1, t_2, ...., t_n\epsilon S$, ($Z_{t_1}, ..., Z_{t_n}$) is a [[Multivariate Gaussian]].
