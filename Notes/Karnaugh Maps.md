# Karnaugh Maps

> [!note]
> An simple and efficient method for finding the simplified boolean expression by using its truth table. 1s are placed in squares with minterms while 0s are placed in squares with maxterms. Simplified expressions are found by grouping 1s or 0s in 2^n sized groups.

> [!example]
> $f = \sum m(0, 2, 4, 5, 6)$

> $= \overline{x_3} + x_1 * \overline{x_2}$
