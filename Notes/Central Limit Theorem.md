# Central Limit Theorem

> [!note] 
> Given a population, if you take the means of sufficiently large samples from the population, the distribution of those means is a [[Normal Distribution]].

> [!info] 
> Regardless of the distribution data comes from, the average of the sufficently large samples (of the same size $n$) from a data population will form a normal distribution.
> This allows methods that only work on normal distributiuons to also work on non-normal distributions
> - Mean of samples $\approx$ population mean -> $\mu_{\bar{x}} \approx \mu$
> - standard deviation of samples} $\approx$ population standard deviation $/$ square root of size of each sample - > $\sigma_{\bar{x}} \approx \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
