# Contrastive Learning

>[!note]
> Uses unlabeled [[Data]] to learn [[Embeddings]] where [[Similarity|similar]] objects are close together, and [[Dissimilarity|dissimilar]] objects are far apart.

> [!method]
> Given one object, an augmentation is applied. The [[Machine Learning Model|model]] is then trained to generate [[Embeddings]] for the augmentation that are very similar to the original object, and very different from other objects. The [[Process]] is repeated until convergence occurs.
