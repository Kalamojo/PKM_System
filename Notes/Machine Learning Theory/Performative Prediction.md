# Performative Prediction

>[!note]
> Predictions that influence the outcome they aim to predict, acting as self-fulfilling prophecies.

> [!example]
> Consider an example where the [[Function]] is a bank's prediction of credit card default risk: The bank might decide that a loan applicant has a very high chance of defaulting, and in response, might assign an very high interest rate. However, this high interest rate, in turn, increases the default risk of the applicant.
