# Data Engineering

> [!note]
>The design, construction, and maitenance of [[Data]] systems.

## Data Engineers
Data Engineers are programmers that don't mess with [[Statistics]] much. They may work as database architects or database developers.
They prefer to design and build IT systems rather than analyze data like [[Notes/Data Science]] professionals. They are more interested in _how_ over _why_.

## Tasks
- Designing systems to collect, handle, and store big datasets
- Build scalable platforms for data processing
- Design, build, and maintain systems that store and move data
