# Product of Sum Form


```ad-note
An output function or circuit can be expressed as the product of maxterms. The maxterms that make up the equation depend on the truth table of the function, specifically at the positions where f (the output) = 0.
```
```ad-example
POS($x_1x_2'$) = $(x_1+x_2)(x_1+x_2')(x_1'+x_2')$
```
