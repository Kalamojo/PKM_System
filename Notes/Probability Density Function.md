# Probability Density Function

```ad-note
Is used to specify the probability of the random variable $x$ falling within a particular ==range== of values.
```

```ad-math
$$P(X\epsilon [a,b]) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$$
$f$ obeys the basic rules of probability, such that it is non-negative and the sum of all probabilities adds up to 1.
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \,dx = 1$$
```
