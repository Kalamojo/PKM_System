# Probability Density Function

> [!note]
> Is used to specify the probability of the random variable $x$ falling within a particular ==range== of values.

> [!math]
> $P(X\epsilon [a,b]) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \,dx$
> $f$ obeys the basic rules of probability, such that it is non-negative and the sum of all probabilities adds up to 1.
> $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \,dx = 1$
