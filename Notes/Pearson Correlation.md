# Pearson Correlation


```ad-note
A measure of the strength of the relationship between variables. 
Also known as the standardized covariance, obtained by dividing the covariance by the standard deviation of each variable.
```

```ad-math
$$p_{1 2} = \frac{\sigma_{1 2}}{\sigma_1 \sigma_2} = \frac{\sigma_{1 2}}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 \sigma_2^2}}$$
$\sigma_{1 2}=$ covariance
$\sigma=$ standard deviation of variable
$\sigma^2=$ variance of variable
```
