# Language Reliability

>[!note]
> The ability of a language to reduce the burden of programmers to identify errors before a program runs. How "crash proof" a language is.

> [!example]
> Python's flexibility actually makes it less reliable. Because data types don't need to be defined, you only find type errors once your program has been run.

> [!example] 
> Ada
