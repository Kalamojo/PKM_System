# RPG Storyline

## Event Types

### General Event
> [!example] 
> I am a rogue so I start off in the ___ lands. I have the option of picking up one of 3 items:
> - Sturdy vest
> - Silent sandals
> - Smooth grindstone
> 
> The vest gives armor, the sandals increase evasiveness, and the grindstone raises crit chances.
> This scenerio is what I consider a **general** event. This means that regardless of the path a user takes, they will be given this choice (though the names may be sligthly different).

### Divergent Event
> [!example] 
> "There appears to be a fork in the road..."
> - The left path is wide, bright, and well-structured
> - The right path is narrow, dark, and shoddy
> - You could also cross the lake straight ahead using the paddleboat docked in front
> 
> The choice the player makes here will influence how events will progress for the rest of the game. Two players that make different choices at these events will have their paths **diverge**.

## Update 1
After assessing the complexity this game will alredy have, I have decided to leave out automatic storyline divergence by way of machine learning. This would certainly make the project more interesting, and perhaps even popular, but it is not feasable at my current level.
To ensure that I don't get ahead of myself (and end up dropping this project after months of playing around), I will take small steps and just build something that works first. Hard-coding each possible storyline will give me an appreciation of the art that may even give me insights into its automatic counterpart.
The AI final boss is still a go, but at the moment, the storyline will be hard-coded.
