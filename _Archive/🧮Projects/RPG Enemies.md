# RPG Enemies

## Run-Down
Reinforcment learning will be used to create a final boss that "knows" the player's every move. Either that, or the boss will use it's limited moveset optimally, having learned the best way to play the game regardless of it's opponent.

### Training against player
While it would be nice to simply have the boss meet up with the player multiple times to train (or to learn from minions that fight our player), this process may not be feasable due to the sheer amount of training RL modles need to become proficient.
If some method could be developed to allow the model to already know somethings but to rapidly discover the player's playstyle, this may still be an option.

### Training against itself
