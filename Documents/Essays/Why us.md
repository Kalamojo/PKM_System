## [[🏫 UT Austin#Short Answers]]
When I find myself occupied physically with a chore or walk, I usually take the opportunity to listen to the newest episode of my favorite podcasts. Podcasts are wonderful for a number of reasons. They can be downloaded and listened to online, they are generally free content and easily accessible, and finally, the point I find to be the most important, they feature pure audio without any other distractions.
There is something almost mystical about hearing an expert in a certain field simply talk about who they are and what they do. Podcasts like “The Jordan Harbinger Show” and “The Talking Machines” feature such individuals and listening to their testimonies has changed my view of academics. The episode featuring UT Austin’s very own Professor Sinead Williamson provided me some insight on the learning environment at the university and has inspired me even further to pursue an education here.
I love academic podcasts especially their speakers for sharing what they view as important and discoveries they have made. I love the communities like the Machine Learning and Data Science club at UT for their environment of learning and discovery. More than anything, I just love the talk around academia. Open discussion about personal development and academic topics can lead to a more open world. Regardless of the field I decide to settle in by the end of my experience at UT, I want to share what I learn with the world and maybe give my own talk on a podcast one day.
I still have a long way to go until I reach that point, but I can start by sharing idea with the people around me, one discussion at a time.

## [[🏫 Cornell#Short Answers]]
The most striking detail about Cornell's engineering program is the plethora of subjects and academic areas it holds. From Earth and Atmospheric Sciences to Civil Engineering, it is incredible how many options exist in the program. By placing all these areas of study under one college, cross-discipline collaboration can also occur. It is one large community that builds its students up and inspires teamwork.
Another exciting feature of Cornell Engineering is its research opportunities, especially for undergraduate students. Students have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and make discoveries without waiting for graduate school. In addition to making discoveries, students are also encouraged to collaborate with their peers and world-class faculty. It would be a great way to explore my interests further and work with others.
Cornell Engineering provides all the freedom and options of a large institution without sacrificing any of the quality of education. I wish to see for myself what I can achieve while attending it.

## [[🏫 Rice#Short Answers]]
More than any other university I have come across, Rice holds both an elite academic setting as well as a top-notch campus. The city of Houston adds to to the experience in a way that highlights the quality of live at Rice. Many universities overlook the less obvious aspects of college like campus quality, but it is an important area to consider. If I am going to spend the next four years of my life at one institution, I will try my best to find a place that suits me just as much as the academics. Rice is the answer to my search, and I am fortunate to have the opportunity to continue my higher education there.
