### Waffle

- This program provides financial support that will allow me to focus on developing skills vital to my career without as much worry for how to sustain that development
- I know that I am capable to thriving in CMU's Computer Science Master's program, and I know that I have the potential to truly impact this field. The Rales Fellows Program provides not only the opportunity to prove such, but also a community of other innovators and achievers to help push me toward my goals
- I want to help devise solutions to as many problems I can in this field and outside of it, not purely for the sense of achievement and proficiency it would bring, but to help inspire students with a similar background. Seeing examples of people who have accomplishments very similar to your own desires lets you know that they are technically possible, but seeing people from your own country, religion, or even geographical location accomplish those things makes those achievements real and even feasible. I want to be a person like this for Nigerians, Catholics, and even Texans all around.

### Cleaned Up

My first reason for applying to the CMU Rales Fellows Program is undoubtedly the financial support that the fellowship would provide. This support would allow me to focus on developing skills vital to my career without excessive worry about how to sustain that development financially. More importantly, however, joining the Rales Fellows community would bring me closer to my goals in the field of Computer Science. I know that I am capable of thriving in CMU's Computer Science Master's program, and I know that I have the potential to make an impact in this field. The Rales Fellows program provides the opportunity to prove such in addition to a community of other innovators and driven individuals to help push me toward those goals. The chance to join this community and simply have conversations with other students is invaluable.
Ultimately, my mission is to help devise solutions to as many problems possible in this field and outside of it, not purely for the sense of achievement or proficiency it would bring, but to help inspire those from similar backgrounds as I. Seeing examples of individuals with accomplishments similar to one's own desires lets one know that they are technically possible. However, seeing people from one's own country, religion, or even geographical location dream the same dreams makes their achievements far more realistic and feasible. The presence of representation has strengthened my own resolve to pursue a graduate degree here at CMU. I want to be this person for any Nigerian, Catholic, Texan, or even student who has or will share my interests, and joining the Rales Fellows is a significant step to that end.

## Qualities From Experience; Program Gain

> [!info]
> How has your lived experience informed the qualities you’ll bring to the Rales Fellows cohort community? What do you hope to gain from being part of a diverse community of STEM leaders? (300 words or less)

### Waffle

- A key quality I have fostered over my life is never assuming that I am incapable of understanding/doing something. This confidence was grown by my mentors, professors, peers and family. By expecting the levels of excellence they expect in themselves, and helping me to reach those levels if I failed at first, they taught me that there are far less impossible things than I previously assumed.
- There is a quote that you are the sum of the 5 people closest to you. Surrounding oneself with people at or below their level, or with interests far removed from their own, is not conducive to pushing oneself past their limits. By joining this community filled with individuals that have accomplished things in my field of interest, or who simply have a level of interest that meets or even exceeds my own, I can guarantee a desire to pursue excellence personally.

### Cleaned up

A fundamental quality I have fostered over my lifetime is never assuming that I am incapable of understanding or doing anything. While this may seem a fine line away from arrogance, it focuses less on assuming I know everything and more on how I've learned that virtually everything is learnable. This stance mainly stems from my experience with early-college high school in which I learned alongside students years older than I. My professors held identical expectations for me as they did for every other student, so I tried my best to deliver on those expectations. My internship manager gave me tasks similar to the 2-3 years senior students on my team, so I worked on completing those tasks like the others. The same occurred in my full-time position with coworkers far older than me. In each step of my life, the expectations of my mentors, professors, peers, and family have instilled in me confidence in the possibility of achieving those expectations.
As for the qualities I hope to gain from joining this community, drive is among the most important. There is a quote by Jim Rohn that states, "You're the average of the five people spend the most time with." Surrounding oneself with people at or below one's current level, or with interests far removed from their own pursuits, is not conducive to pushing oneself past one's limits. By joining this community filled with individuals who have accomplishments in my field of interest, or who simply have an eagerness to learn that meets or even exceeds my own, I can guarantee a desire to pursue excellence personally. I hope to share and receive these and many other qualities with others if accepted into the program.

## Important Accomplishments

### Waffle

- It is tempting to list achievements like my SAT score of 1560, or obtaining an internship and full time software engineering offer at the age of 18, but not only are they extremely superficial, they hardly even fulfill the meaning of 'accomplishments'.
- In 5th grade, I had scored a 70 on a major English exam, but by the end of the year, I achieved a score of 98 on the Final Exam, one of the highest grades in the class. I confirmed for myself that my brain wasn't "not built" for English. Furthermore, I reinforced the idea that virtually anything is learnable if I put in effort and make use of available resources.
- My next major accomplishment was solving my first programming problem, FizzBuzz. This helped me realize that coding was a viable way of creating verifiably functioning and useful solutions for all kinds of problems.
- Helping my friend debug her Java program filled me with a deep sense of accomplishment, and helped me to realize the fulfillment I gained in helping others find solutions.

### Cleaned up

My first temptation is to list impressive scores or positions I have obtained, like scoring 1560 on my SAT or procuring an internship and full-time software engineering offer at 18. Not only are these achievements extremely superficial, each hardly even fulfills the meaning of 'accomplishments.' What's more is that in the context of my life goals and personal development, they hardly matter at all.
In 5th grade, I was struggling with the subject of English. I began to feel despair after scoring poorly on a major exam. I had never enjoyed the subject, and performing poorly in the course simply reinforced that attitude. However, the despair I felt from my suboptimal score drove me to attempt to save my grade, and with guidance from my teacher plus an excessive amount of studying, by the end of the year, I achieved one of the highest scores in the class on the Final Exam. I had broken the belief that my mind was 'not built' for English. Furthermore, it was one of the first instances where I fostered the idea that nearly anything is learnable with enough effort and assistance from others.
My next major accomplishment was solving my first programming problem, FizzBuzz. After struggling with the task for hours, and slowly coming to regret learning to code along the way, the sense of accomplishment I felt was unlike any other before. I had created something by stringing together a couple of keywords and characters, something working and reusable. Unlike English, no one needed to double-check the sentiment of what I had written. When I provided a multiple of 3 as an input, 'Fizz' was printed, and when I provided a multiple of 5, 'Buzz' was the result, and regardless of my specific methodology in creating that program, its functionality was undeniable. With this accomplishment, I came to appreciate the practicality and instant applicability of programming.
The final accomplishment I'll discuss here doesn't even focus on a task I completed personally. Rather, it was an instance in which I helped someone else accomplish their goals. My friend was running into issues with her Java project, struggling to find the piece of her code responsible for the program's failure. By meeting with her, suggesting changes to reveal how the program was currently functioning, and ultimately identifying a couple of bugs, she was able to fix her issues and run the program successfully. While I had already begun to appreciate the satisfaction derived from creating a working program, I had never realized just how great it felt to help another achieve that end.
Accomplishing these tasks brought me no accolades, recognition, or external rewards. However, they each brought me closer to understanding myself and appreciating the field in which I am now pursuing higher education. They accomplished far more than my standardized test scores ever did and have shaped me into who I am today.

## Resilience

- My challenge was receiving and coming to terms with college application decisions. I was forced to consider my intelligence, abilities, and self-worth.
- I came to realize that University admissions are made by people assessing me with limited metrics, not an objective, all-encompassing measure of my worth. I acknowledged two things: 1. that I could have sold myself in a better way for applications, and that if I wanted better results in the future, I had to work on that like any other skill, and 2. there is a difference between perceived and actual worth, and that to achieve the results I wanted, I needed to work on bringing those two closer together.

### Cleaned Up

Probably the most challenging time for me was post-undergraduate application season. Outside the university with which my early college credits were associated, I had received rejections from every school I applied to. The emotions I went through in this period were not those of feeling slighted or wronged by my rejections. On the contrary, I took those rejections as a sign of my own inadequacy. There were simply better applicants than I, with better grades, more interesting extracurricular activities, and more compelling essays. These rejections forced me to consider my intelligence, abilities, and even self-worth. While I had always had self-confidence, it was difficult to argue with the apparently objective decision-making of Universities I had dreamed of attending for years.
To stop myself from spiraling down the path of self-pity and hopelessness, I forced myself to come to terms with a number of things. For one, I acknowledged that University admissions are decided by people assessing students with limited metrics and that it is by no means an objective, all-encompassing measure of worth. Next, and likely the most significant realization for preventing similar events from occurring again, I acknowledged that I honestly could have made better applications. I presented myself in poor ways, and if I wanted better results in the future, I had to work on improving my presentation skills just like any other. Finally, I realized that there was a difference between perceived and actual worth and that if I wanted to achieve my goals in life, I needed to work on bringing the two closer together. Rejection was a frustration that I could do nothing about, but my response to the rejections was another matter entirely.

### Waffle

- I believe there has been a trend of making assumptions of a Machine Learning model's capabilities based on perceived performance.
- For example, we train Large Language Models to generate the next most probable words based on the large collection of text they trained on. Then we somehow expect these models to perform well on benchmarks like solving word-based math problems, a task that takes reasoning ability.
- Another example is a case uncovered in a research paper analyzing the shortcomings of 'state of the art' image classification models. While these models performed remarkably well at classifying stock images of animals with high accuracy, the trouble came when the texture of the images were modified. An image of a cat was photoshopped to have the texture of an elephant, and when given to the model, the class of 'elephant' was assigned with high confidence. It was found that these models where not identifying subjects in the way humans do, such as considering the shape of the object in the image, but rather simply used color and texture to make it's predictions. For images taken in the dark, or with unclear-texture, these models would undoubtedly fail.
- I want to work on uncovering similar limitations in models, acknowledging their nature to solve the problems given to them in any way they can, and in ways that we don't fully understand yet. I also wish to develop methods of enabling true reasoning and understanding in ML models to prepare them for real-world applications.

### Cleaned Up

Large Language Models are generally trained with large, often extremely large, collections of words. Then, we ask these models a simple question: given a set of words, what is the most probably following word? With this process, we can ask models questions and receive remarkably human-like answers that (often) respond to the prompt while (often) making grammatical sense. Yet when evaluating LLMs, a popular benchmark is to have these models attempt to solve mathematical word problems directly. What's more is that these models have increasingly been used to tackle a whole range of problems, from generating code to data analytics, and dips in performance are often 'solved' by using a larger model. I believe there is a disconnect here. It has become increasingly easy to suppose, "Since this model is able to respond to my question, it must have understood it. Therefore, it should be capable of this other task that requires reasoning." Once we as humans see an agent apparently performing near or at our level, we make unreasonable assumptions as to what that agent is capable of.
This phenomenon isn't just limited to Large Language Models either. A 2018 paper by Geirhos et al. uncovered the shortcomings of 'state of the art' image classification models. These models performed remarkably well in classifying stock images of animals, achieving more than 90% accuracy for the ImageNet dataset. However, when evaluated on a custom dataset of animals with modified texture, performance was far worse. For example, an image of a cat was manipulated to have a texture similar to that of an elephant while retaining the same shape as a cat. When supplied to these models, the class of 'elephant' was predicted with overwhelming confidence. Upon testing these models further, researchers found that some had up to an 82.8% bias for texture over shape, settling a long-standing debate on the subject and far-contradicting what many had imagined. Once again, high performance in one task (classifying standard images) led people to make assumptions as to how the models 'think', and in this case, these assumptions have a potentially more negative impact. Image classification models that perform exceptionally well on standardized image datasets may perform poorly in real-world settings. If such a model is used with a security camera in a low-light setting, it may perform poorly due to a lack of clear texture. Without understanding how these systems work, we may jeopardize their effectiveness.
My research goal is to unearth how Machine Learning models are actually learning to avoid these situations. Furthermore, I hope to help develop ways to bypass these limitations, like training on custom datasets for robustness or developing entirely new models to tackle specific use cases. In most cases, ML models try everything they can to minimize measured loss, and it is amazing how many problems they can solve with this approach. It's my mission to help determine how this approach differs from our own approaches to learning and to bring the two closer together where possible.
