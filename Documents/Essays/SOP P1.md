## Introduce Who You Are

### Notes

- I'm a Nigerian Immigrant who was told that he was smart, yet had no direction for a course of study
	- Until I found computer science which gave me a direction and purpose for my studies

- There have been many things in my life that have been decided for me, and where I have little control over
	- However, I found that I had few excuses when it came to programming projects
	- Nothing was stopping me from creating a personal website or implementing a machine learning algorithm I learned in class
	- I could do whatever I wanted, and the only limit was my own motivation and creativity

- As far as I can remember, I've always hated studying, and always got by in courses by figuring out the kind of responses Teachers wanted to see
	- Mathematics was good because things where unambiguous. Right answers were right because you could check them with an equation
	- But in programming, not only could answers be checked easily (a program returning the correct output), but there were also a multitude of ways to achieve that answer

- I completely separated study and work from personal time
	- Programming doesn't feel like work I would find myself working on personal projects in the middle of a lecture
	- There's a quote from Ben Wilson from the HTTOTW podcast about doing what you love doesn't feel like work

### Abrasive Draft

<mark>My education journey, while spanning 2 continents and 8 different schools, was fairly consistent up until 10th grade.</mark>

After emigrating from Nigeria to the US, I simply went through the motions of a standard student, working on schoolwork while in school and goofing off while at home. I followed this way of life almost religiously, refusing to do schoolwork at home to maintain this separation. I suppose it was out of the necessity to keep this lifestyle that I even forwent studying after school, forcing me to pay attention and focus while in class, and consequently shaped me into an apperently intelligent student. 

I was placed into a gifted and talented program in 4th grade, received consistent A's in the overwhelming majority of my courses, and was told repeatedly by teachers that I was intelligent and held a lot of promise.
> Don't yap about how gifted you are cuh

However, my continued efforts to completely segregate my studies and my personal life innevitably took their toll.
I rarely joined clubs since they used up time that could have been used hanging out with friends. Academic competitions were completely out of the question, especially since I already spent most of my life on academics. I was even reluctant to pursue after-school sports, viewing them as extra stress after the daily stress of taking classes and exams. I had my life figured out: work, and then play, completely distinct and with their own alloted times. The change of this lifestyle was by no means instantaneous. <mark>It began when I took a Computer Science Principles course during Sophomore year of high school, and our first assignment was to use a programming environemnt named Jeroo to move these kangaroo avatars through obstacle courses and solve puzzles.</mark> After speeding through an assignment, I found myself impatient to work on the next. The assignments made sense in such a fundamental way, and I often looked ahead to see what projects were coming next. The worst feeling in the world was when I was running into some error in my program, but could not solve it before the bell rang. It got to the point where I would find myself visualizing the program I was working on in class on the bus ride back home, trying to imagine what I was missing.

And on one fateful day, after being unable to complete a particularly tricky assignment during class time, I found my Dad's laptop at home, inserted the flashdrive with my assignment, and got to work. While I had certainly worked on homework at home in the past, it had always been due to a fast approaching deadline or upon the insistance of my parents. This was the first time I did schoolwork because I truly wanted to, and I found that it hardly felt like schoolwork at all. There was just something about solving problems in this way that was irresistable to me, and I realized two things at once: first, I was going to spend less time wasting time after school, but more importantly, I had finally found my calling.
> Kinda cringe, this is still an essay for professors

#### Notes

- Stated intelligence is irrelevant
- Should focus purely on the lifestyle, what challenged that lifestyle, and why

### Rough Draft

My education journey, while spanning 2 continents and 8 different schools, was fairly consistent up until 10th grade. After emigrating from Nigeria to the US, I simply went through the motions of a standard student, and slowly began developing habits for schoolwork. I started making conscious efforts to separate my academic endeavors from my personal interests. Homework, projects, and even studying was done in class whenever possible to maximize my free time at home. It wasn't until my Sophomore year of high school that I found any reason to contradict this lifestyle. I took a required Computer Science Principles course, and our first assignment was to use a programming environment called Jeroo to move these kangaroo avatars through obstacle courses and solve puzzles. Those programming assignments were the first pieces of schoolwork that I willingly thought about and completed outside of class. There was something about solving problems in this way that was irresistible to me, and I began to consider a future that involved programming professionally. My personal interests and academic pursuits had finally collided.
