## Jaws

The first major surprise that each group member experienced was seeing *Jaws* placed at number one on everyone's list. While I had thought that it was a great all-around movie, seeing my group mates confirm this solidified my opinion. Each and every one of us thought that *Jaws* was the best film screened in the course, and that fact alone gives the film credibility. Due to our resounding agreement, not much discussion was held for the title. In terms of the qualities that placed it so high, we all agreed that *Jaws* had everything you could ask for in a movie: an engaging plot, an intriguing premise, memorable actors, and an element of suspense that kept us glued to the screen. Personally, my favorite aspect of the film was that the air of suspense was constantly persistent. Even without seeing the primary antagonist (the shark) for the majority of the film, I was invested in every twist and turn.

## Rocky

*Rocky* was the first film for which our group had some disagreement on placing. The story of a no-name boxer facing off against a heavyweight champion was an almost classic underdog story that was extremely successful in the public eye. Multiple group members placed it as their second favorite film, which heavily influenced its placing on this list. I and another group member did not place it so high, however. In my own case, this was due to *Rocky*'s lack of artistic complexity and depth. It was certainly an entertaining piece, but in my mind, it was entirely predictable and only conventionally interesting. Where I agree with my teammates, however, is on the power of the story as well as the execution of the piece. The fight was masterfully performed, fit with special effects and exciting action. Rocky himself was a surprisingly likable character as well, which also raised the films standing among our group.

## Pulp Fiction

Among our final selection of movies, the film I pushed most strongly for was *Pulp Fiction*. While my three group members individually placed it at 5th, 4th, and even off the list, I placed it at second place, and for good reason. Out of the wide array of films that I watched during this course, *Pulp Fiction* held the best display of acting by far. Actors like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta made *Pulp Fiction* an immersive and impactful experience. This, paired with the unconventional filming style of breaking the film into parts, make *Pulp Fiction* memorable, if nothing else. What ended up being its primary issue (among my team) was one of its best features (for me): the complex storyline. Some group members found the plot to be confusing and hard to follow, which detracted from the effectiveness of the storytelling. However, once the plot was understood, they agreed that the film was certainly a good one. This, paired with my own defense of the production, allowed *Pulp Fiction* to be placed so high.

## Taxi Driver

The placing of *Taxi Driver* among my teammates convinced me that I lacked a taste for some artistic aspects of the film. Personally, I thought that the movie was interesting at first, often disturbing, and simply strange throughout. I would never casually watch this film, and I certainly wouldn't recommend others to do so. That being said, *Taxi Driver* was not lacking in artistry. Here was the way one group member described it: "I liked the concept of it just a dude who was driven a little crazy by his thoughts and the world around him." They also mentioned the unique cinematography and voice-overs in the film, two features that added to its artistic nature. For one with basic tastes, like myself, the lack of an antagonist and consistent conflict simply made the experience strange. However, I cannot deny that the movie was chock-full of imagery and meaning. It was certainly not bland.

## Bonnie and Clyde

With the exception of *Jaws*, our group's placing of *Bonnie and Clyde* was the most consistent in our lists. Two of us (myself included) had placed the film at 4th, one at 5th, and another at 6th place. While it was one of the first films screened in the course, we all remembered it to be a unique and captivating example of what early cinema looked like. To me, it even seemed ahead of its time, making two criminals the funny, respectable, and loving characters protagonists. It made these outcasts and "bad" people extremely likable. As audience members, our team personally enjoyed watching the couple's exploits and adventures. Conversely, the end of Bonnie and Clyde's adventures, paired with the tragedy that befell their family, was painful to witness. It's not every day that you hope that a couple of criminals will outwit and escape law enforcement, which attests to the ingenuity of the plot of *Bonnie and Clyde* as well as the acting.

## Ferris Bueller's Day Off

Funnily enough, *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* was the only film on this list that I was opposed to placing any higher. While there were no glaring issues with the film, as my teammates agreed, there was also very little present to make the film intriguing. *Ferris Bueller's Day Off* is the kind of film I could watch once and never desire to ever see again. It possessed a laughable conflict that was difficult to be invested in. That being said, as reflected by the rankings of my teammates, it certainly wasn't a terrible movie. There was a little bit of comedy, a lot of high-school fun, and a general carefree air that is reminiscent of many modern-day productions geared toward teenagers. In all fairness, it was an okay/good movie that was somewhat enjoyable to watch. In the setting of a film class, however, it would be irresponsible for me to not point out its lack of depth, mediocre acting, and uninspiring plot.

## Casablanca

Film critics everywhere are probably extremely disappointed with our group's placing of *Casablanca* on this list and for valid reasons. It was a historically impactful movie that was pivotal in the development of future films. It also had a very unique storyline with an interesting conflict. At face value, it seems like a wonderful production deserving of its many accolades. However, actually watching the film reveals some negative aspects as well. Among my group members, the number one issue with *Casablanca* is its boring nature. Being the only black-and-white film screened doesn't help, but even besides that, the story of Rick and Ilsa's love was simply not as captivating as the other films on this list. It was placed at the bottom of almost everyone's list (and even off the bottom of my list), which is a very strong indicator of the entertainment factor of *Casablanca*. To more amateur tastes, like ours, it was not engaging.

# Narrative

Originally, we had planned to hold an online meeting to discuss and debate our rankings of each movie. However, conflicts with each member's schedules (as well as some mismanagement of time) prevented this from happening. Because we had already begun talking through Whatsapp, we decided that our discussion would simply continue there.
One of the biggest issues we faced was communicating with group members through messages alone. It was difficult to find a time when all group members were active and ready to discuss our lists, and even more difficult to generate meaningful discussion on the subject. Without a concrete time block for our "meeting", we struggled with completing all of our tasks in a timely manner. That said, we were able to derive meaningful results from messaging, and we were able to ultimately create a team list combining each of our preferences.
Kesley led the discussion, prompting each member about individual lists as well as times to meet/discuss our rankings. Personally, I did a lot of the arguing for the placing of specific films like *Pulp Fiction* and *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*. Each member posted their own lists, and we did our best to combine them in an intelligent manner. It was interesting to find the similarities in our reviews, like for *Jaws*, *Bonnie and Clyde*, and *Casablanca*. However, I found the differences in our opinions to be more interesting. *Taxi Driver*, for instance, didn't even receive a place on my list. Among my teammates, however, it seemed to be a very well-made film with a refreshing cinematic style. Conversely, I had placed *Reality Bites* as my number three best film in this course, but no one else had even placed it on their list.
I found that learning about the intricacies of films was far more interesting than I ever would have believed before taking this course. Previously, the amount of action or humor a film possessed decided how much I enjoyed it. While my personality and preferences have not completely shifted, I have gained an appreciation for the cinematic arts I never imagined possessing. I hope to use this new lens to appreciate movies more in the future, as well as bond with others over discussion on the subject.
