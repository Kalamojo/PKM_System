## [[üè´ Carnegie Mellon#Short Answers]]
Throughout my Junior and Senior high school years, I have experimented with various learning methods and techniques to discover the best way to learn. It has not been an easy task, and I have tried everything from written notes to typed, planners to todo-lists, and calendars to time-blocking. I have sampled these methods with varying results, and I still have a ways to go to make something final.
Having the opportunity to experiment with high-level curriculum and activities would go a long way in helping me find an academic system. I could also find inspiration from other students, noting how they get things done.
A successful college experience is one in which I have worked out a productivity system that makes the best use of my time and efforts.
In addition to general productivity, I wish to finalize my academic major and career options. Even as I apply for universities and select my major for each one, I find myself unsure of the specific path to take. Computer Science is a vast field with many disciplines, and it is daunting knowing that I will have to make a decision. Listening to academic and industry professionals speak about their line of work, especially in Computer Science, has made it clear that these men and women enjoy their professions and find their work fulfilling. One day, I wish to find that same fulfillment in whichever field of study I choose.
