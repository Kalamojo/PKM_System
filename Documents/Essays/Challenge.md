“Should I get the mail, Mom?” my sister asked. I rushed to the mailbox, beating my sister to the punch. After a quick review, I found what I was looking for: my semester report card. I was immediately disappointed to find that my specific grades were not included in the letter. Instead, it was a notice that my grades were posted on my school website. I visited the site, logged into my account, found my grades, and…. was devastated. I had never performed more poorly in my entire academic career. I sat there in disbelief, certain that it was some sort of mistake.
My transition to MSA during 2020 seemed easy at first. With only 2 classes a day and asynchronous material, my school day was free. Professors didn’t ask me to meet with them if I was performing poorly in class. Assignments could be postponed until the very last minute without repercussion. Class meetings were optional, some exams were open-notes, and free-time was abundant. I grew complacent. I stopped worrying about the semester project due next week and instead spent time chatting with my friends. I attended most lectures but only paying half-attention. “I’m a smart kid”, I told myself. I had never previously had any problems with academics. I didn’t use a planner, didn’t study, and generally didn’t work hard for my grades. I was certainly in for a rude awakening when I viewed my results for the first time.
Out of my 4 courses for the semester, I received two Cs and one B. I had only received anything less than an A once in my entire life. With these grades came an overwhelming sense of anxiety. My ego, fueled by my nearly flawless academic record, began to crumble. I flagged behind my friends in the MSA ranking system. Every moment of my Christmas break that year was filled with second guessing and regret. I constantly beat myself up, thinking that I wasn’t as smart as I previously believed. I was left wondering if I really belonged in program at all.
This experience taught me some valuable lessons about college in general. For one, I am the only person that has a say in my success. College courses were so wildly different from classical high school settings in the sense that teachers weren’t as invested in my future. For the most part, I didn’t have anyone reminding me about deadlines or Exam dates. I was forced to remind myself to get back to work and avoid distractions.
I also knew I had to change my productivity system if I wanted to improve my scores. I created a dedicated to-do list online, began studying for exams using flashcards and spaced repetition, and I learned to set aside time for school and leisure. Books like Cal Newport’s “Deep Work” and various episodes from The Jordan Harbinger Show addressing productivity guided this change. I finally feel as if I am controlling my life and not the other way around. While I have always been confident in my abilities, my experience gave me a confidence in my worth ethic and ability to improve.
The following semester, I earned As for all my courses and achieved President’s List. I worked hard for those grades, and I was glad to see my struggle pay off. Even now, I look back on my Junior year of High School and think to myself “if only”. However, I know that the only option I have is to move forward with my life and try my best from now on. As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

## [[💸 Bold Turnaround Story]]
It was Quarter 4 of 6th grade, and my class prepared to take the IA (Independent Assessment) in English class. I nervously waited at my desk, dreading what was to come. English had never been my favorite subject. I had struggled with it throughout my life, usually receiving barely commendable grades in the courses. There was just something about open-ended questions and the lack of rules in writing that made it difficult for me. I had excelled in the IAs for all my other classes, but I wasn't quite as confident for my current one. Inevitably, the school bell rang and our teacher started the time for the exam.
I scored even worse than I had feared. While my friends received commended marks and high grades, I had almost failed. To make matters worse, students who received commended scores were invited to a school field trip to a restaurant and the park. I was devastated. When the field trip came around, I had to attend daily class while my friends had the time of their lives. Upon their return, they recounted all of the fun they had while away from school. They told me I should have been there, and they were surprised that I didn't attend.
I never wanted to miss an opportunity like that again, so from that point on, I resolved to improve my performance in English. I paid more attention in class, worked harder on essays and reading assignments, and studied harder than ever. When the time came for our final exam, I felt more than ready.
With only one question wrong, I had received the highest grade in the class. More importantly, I had proved to myself that I could improve in any subject with enough hard work and determination.

My partner and I had just begun the CAHSI South Texas Virtual Hackathon of 2021. We were communicating through online messaging and rushing to gain a foothold in the competition. We were just like the 20 other teams participating, except for one detail: two of our group members never showed up. In addition to our lack of manpower, we also had trouble installing John the Ripper: software necessary for password hashing and cracking. With only two members and fewer points available, our situation looked bleak. However, while I was unhappy with the situation we found ourselves in, I was not about to take a loss lying down.
I exchanged rapid messages with my partner to divide our work and give us the best fighting chance possible. We solved each problem with our own resources, asking each other questions when we got stuck. While we were unable to answer password-related questions, we completed most of the others.
By the time the competition was over and the results were displayed, my partner and I were astonished: we got 7th place! I realize that in the grand scheme of things, achieving 7th out of 20 teams is not impressive by itself. However, through collaboration and extreme focus my partner and I performed much better than we had ever hoped. We made the most of our situation and achieved results we could be proud of.

Participating in my classes with online meetings and assignments has been a significant challenge, especially in the Covid-19 pandemic early stages. During my Junior year, I struggled to adapt to my new situation in addition to my new school. College courses were wildly different from my previous high school arrangements. As a result, my grades during Junior year suffered, and I received substantially lower marks for my classes. Since then, I have changed my learning approach, and my achievement has rebounded significantly.

During Christmas break of 2020, I visited my school website, logged into my account, and discovered my grades for the semester. I was devastated by what I saw. I had never performed more poorly in my entire academic career. I sat there in disbelief, convinced that a mistake had occurred.
My transition to my new high school during 2020 seemed easy at first. My school day was practically free. Professors didn’t ask me to meet with them when I performed poorly in class. I postponed assignments until the very last minute without repercussion. Class meetings were optional, exams were open notes, and free time was plentiful. I grew complacent. I stopped worrying about the semester project due next week and instead spent time chatting with my friends. I attended most lectures, only half paying attention. “I’m a smart kid,” I told myself.

Out of my four courses for the semester, I received two Cs and one B. I had only received anything less than an A once in my entire life. With these poor grades came an overwhelming sense of anxiety. Every moment of my Christmas break, I felt steep regret. I constantly beat myself up, thinking that I was unintelligent. I was left wondering if I belonged in the program at all.

While rejection from a prestigious University is not challenging in itself, coping with that rejection certainly is. When I was rejected from Princeton University a month ago, I was devastated. I had placed so much hope in my prospects, from planning traveling and college expenses to considering my Princeton after-graduation plans. After viewing the rejection letter, I felt the sharp ache of disappointment deep in my core. A world of possibility had just been closed off to me, which was a challenging reality to reconcile.
Regardless of how long I moped around, pitying myself, I knew that my situation would not change. Steeling myself and continuing my studies was difficult, but I endured.
This experience taught me a valuable lesson about perseverance. When a situation is unchangeable, you can either dwell on it or move on. Moving on from rejection wasn't easy, but it was a necessary process that has taught me a lot.
