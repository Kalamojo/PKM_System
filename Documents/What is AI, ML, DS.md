# What is AI, ML, DS

Artificial Intelligence is the automation of human intelligence with the use of computer systems.

AI can be broken up into 9 types
- Problem Solving
- General Intelligence
	- General Intelligence is the far-reaching ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence
	- Artificial General Intelligence would be able to perform a plethora of tasks with minimal instruction, just like a human would
	- Because it is a computer system, it would even be able to outperform humans and learn things exceedingly quick
- Social Intelligence
	- Being able to understand what a human is feeling
	- Responding to a human in a way that eases their troubles
- Motion and Manipulation
- Perception
- Natural Language Processing
	- Anything involving language simulation
	- Inputing speech to search
	- A messaging bot
- Learning
- Planning
	- Artificial intelligence that involves knowing when and how to take actions
	- AI is inside an environment that they must react to
- Knowledge Representation

Weak Artificial Intelligence is the opposite of Generalizable AI. It can only perform a small set of tasks that it is created for.

Artificial Intelligence "Magic" is created by removing more and more layers from the creator of a system. A calculator is not very "magical" since a programmer must explicitly define how calculations will work. In contrast, a machine learning model has a lot of "magic" because it can work with all sorts of inputs and produce outputs in ways that even the programmer might not expect.

The Turing test basically says that if you interact with an Artificial Intelligence system and after thorough inspection you honestly can not tell that it is an AI, then it is truly Intelligent in the magical sense.


Machine Learning is simply using data to learn. Relationships between inputed data and outputs are discovered and made into a Machine Learning Model.

Deep Reinforcement Learning models are as magical as it gets. A Reinforcement Learning model designed to play chess will not only find the best way to win, but will also learn how the game works in general. This is a semblance of understanding.


A Data Scientist is a person that works with Data. Data Science includes Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and anything else related to data.

There are a couple of Data Science roles that follow the data pipeline:
- Data Analyst
	- A technical role
	- Is involved with the entire Data Pipeline, including data ingestion, feature engineering, and working with a data warehouse
	- Uses data analysis process to make human decisions
- Business Intelligence
	- Not very technical
	- Just work with data from data warehouse to draw insights and make decisions
- Machine Learning Engineer
	- Create machine learning model
	- Model takes data, optimises itself, and directly takes action based on its data. This would be a chat bot discovering that the best time to send messages is at 4 pm and automatically sending messages at that time
	- Does not require human decision making

Data Pipeline:
1. Ingestion
2. Manipulation
3. Analysis
	- Data Analysis/Business Intelligence
	- Machine Learning

A dataset is a file with data. An example is a spreadsheet

A data stream is continously inputed data. This could be done using a web scraper or an application that is constantly being updated. Data streams are not stored in files or servers. Instead, they are received, used, and then thrown away.

A data lake is a collection of all the inputed datasets. It has "dirty" data, meaning it has not been manipulated yet.

A feature store is where the data gets manipulated and stored. Feature engineering takes place here, like changing string values into numbers or removing unnecessary parameters. Unlike a datalake, it holds "clean" data.

A data warehouse holds cleaned data from previous steps in a Data Pipline. This is where additional transformations are applied to the data, the most common of which is transfering the data to column format instead of row format. Data Analysts take this extra step to analyze their data.
