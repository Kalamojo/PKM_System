## [[🏫 UT Austin#Short Answers]]
Ever since my Sophomore year of high school, I've been questioning how exactly computers work. It’s mind-boggling that us humans have created devices that can carry out complex instructions and, as advances in Artificial Intelligence have made clear, even "think" for themselves. It became my mission to understand how these machines were able to accomplish this, and possibly even advance the field myself with my own discoveries. Even now, I still don't think I am particularly near to truly understanding these processes, but that is a part of the allure of the field. More and more discoveries in AI are being made seemingly every day, making it a difficult area to keep up with. Old algorithms and statistics equations are being used in nefw Artificial Intelligence models in interesting ways. Many that work with AI, Machine Learning, or even other areas labeled under Computer Science know more than anyone that you must keep learning to keep up. This culture of never-ending learning and discovery is what truly draws me to the field. My interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning specifically has driven me to consider Data Science as a future career. Data Scientists have the opportunity to make use of the discoveries AI researchers have made. They find problems involving tons of Data and make use of a variety of tools to solve them. I wish to someday do this myself, helping companies and individuals make better decisions to reach their fullest potential. Computers are remarkable tools that have revolutionized our lives, and I can think of no better way to spend mine than to maximize their benefits.

## [[💸 Black Students in STEM]]
Throughout my life, I have heard the constantly reappearing question posed to all growing children: What do you want to be when you grow up? This question stressed me out because I had never found the answer or even a passable one. I was merely going along with my education, hoping that I could always make the decision later. School was a constant cycle of homework, lecture, presentations, and tests. Paired with some procrastination and time spent with friends, I didn't seem to have time to take part in personal projects or interests. To put it simply, I wasn't passionate about anything.
Funnily enough, it was the Covid-19 pandemic that pushed me to pursue a STEM role. The sudden change in policies and precautions prompted most students to continue classes online. My parents were forced to provide me with one of the greatest gifts I have ever received: a laptop. I had always considered the item a luxury, and besides my father's work laptop, our family hadn't used them. My gift was a thick Dell PC with minimal processing power and storage. Suddenly, I had the world at my fingertips. I could type documents with ease, create and manipulate all kinds of files, and access and download anything I saw fit from the internet. It was freedom like no other, and I was most worried about accidentally installing a virus onto the device. I began to devote my time to personalizing and organizing it, making it my own. While I went about my new school experience filled with zoom meetings and online material, unfamiliar questions started to form in my mind: How did computers work? Where did they get their power? How could I access so much information from all over the world with this tiny device?
As more and more questions started to form, I became more and more sure of what I wanted to do in life: work with computers. I didn't know job names or any specifics of my desire, but I was set on pushing the limits of the devices. First, I became interested in Computer Engineering and the inner workings of computational devices. Next, I took a liking to Software Development and began learning basic programming. After much switching and consideration, I have settled on Data Science and the applications of Machine Learning.
What I find to be the greatest aspect of Computers is their accessibility. With simple characters and commands, we can bend devices to our will. Full-blown experiments are on small PCs with low processing power. Today, we can even create artificial minds to accomplish tasks for us. It's as if we have the whole world at the tip of our very fingers, and the possibilities of what we can accomplish with that access are limitless. I am passionate about computer science because of its capability to solve problems and help nurture discovery.

Though I have had an interest in Computer Science for years, it took me a while to discover my passion for Data Science specifically. Part of that passion, and the reason for my interest in CS, is the programming involved in the field. Coding has always seemed somewhat mystical to me, in a classic sci-fi/fantasy way. Similar to the mages from books that can manipulate the physical world with the utterance of a few words, programmers can command a device to perform nearly any task by way of programming languages.
However, where Data Science breaks the mold is in the direct usefulness of its practice. Real-world insights are derived every day with a little bit of code. Businesses and individuals benefit immensely from these analyses, applying them to their respective industries.
More than anything else, I think what primarily draws me to Data Science is the community built around it. The field is rapidly growing, in addition to the number of resources and forums available.

## [[🏫 Cornell#Waitlist Prompt]]
Cornell Engineering's Operations Research and Engineering program is a unique mix of statistics, programming, and engineering: a perfect blend for a future career in Data Science. Whether applied to medicine creation, maximizing business profits, or driving an autonomous vehicle, Data Science is a remarkably versatile and crucial field. In addition to its wide range of applications, I enjoy programming solutions to data-related problems. It is an almost blissful balance between work and play that I have come to look forward to between my studies. If unadmitted to Operations Research and Engineering, the Department of Computer Science would be the perfect program to nourish my programming skills and give me a deeper understanding of the essential methods of Data Science.
Aside from the programming, the realm of Data Science contains many intriguing and magical concepts. Transfer learning is a Machine Learning method in which a model can radically change its function without extra training. A model trained to identify cats can be altered slightly to identify dogs instead. There are many other examples, but the common string among them is the revolutionary ability of Data Scientists and programmers to allow programs to "think". Data Science and Machine Learning are subjects that I have found I enjoy immensely, and I aim to further my knowledge in the innovative division of Cornell Engineering.
