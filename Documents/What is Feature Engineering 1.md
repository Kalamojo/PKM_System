# What is Feature Engineering

- Feature engineering refers to a process of selecting and transforming variables when creating a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling (such as deep learning, decision trees, or regression). The process involves a combination of data analysis, applying rules of thumb, and judgement. It is sometimes referred to as pre-processing, although that term can have a more general meaning.
