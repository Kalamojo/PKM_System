## Academic Interests

### Notes

- I'm interested in learning in ML models
	- Transferring learning from one domain to be applied to another
	- Learning from a basic task, and using that learning to drive more complex learning with little raw data
- I'm interested in recommendation
	- Building systems that learn to judge things the same way a person does
- I'm interested in predicting the future

### Rough Draft

From my time studying Computer Science, the most interesting subject for me has been the training of Machine Learning models. It's amazing how simply providing a model a way of measuring it's performance enables it to learn to complete a task, and how that framework has led to models that are able to do things like predict the future and hold conversations with humans. My research with Dr. Ayati of The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley utilized Transfer Learning to predict the development of Alzheimer's from proteomics data, and I found the researching of potential methods to accomplish that task to be the most exciting part of the project. My advisor and I would spend many meetings discussing not only how each method works in practice, but more importantly why they work. Ever since taking an interest in this space, I've found myself attempting to design those integral questions that allow models to achieve answers.
