## COTS HPC 2013 

1. Similar to how GPUs allowed for the "scaling up" of systems far past CPUs, because of their increased performance on arithmetic, are there potentially other processors that could achieve similar up-scaling? Are these TPU's, and if so, why haven't they been adopted more widely in enterprise systems (aside from at Google)?
2. What role does the specific architecture of the model being trained play on the design of cluster setups? Should they always be tailored to each different architectures, or should they be adaptable to a multitude of models?
