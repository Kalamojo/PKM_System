### Abrasive Draft

I can see myself working with Dr. Katerina Fragkiadaki to develop intuitive ways to teach models to create embeddings or predict 3D renders given sets of 2D images, focusing on designing training methods that make use of almost-human perception concepts.

I believe my interests also lie very close to those of Dr. Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and could contribute to one of his multiple emerging research directions pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Deep Learning.

Having conducted research in the Xu lab for the past few months, I'm certain that I would also work well with Dr. Min Xu on his Deep Learning applications in cryo Electron Tomography. While I have found myself to enjoy researching and designing Machine Learning training methods primarily, the methods Dr. Xu has employed for cryo-ET analysis have been very interesting to research, and I can see myself helping to research similar projects in the future.

### Rough Draft

To apply these interests, I hope conduct research here in the Computer Science department. More specifically, I believe my focus on developing innovative learning methods for Machine Learning models aligns very closely with those of Dr. Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and could contribute to one of his multiple emerging research directions pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Deep Learning. I can also see myself working with Dr. Katerina Fragkiadaki to develop intuitive ways to teach models to create embeddings or predict 3D renders given sets of 2D images, focusing on designing training methods that make use of almost-human perception concepts. Having conducted research in the Xu lab for the past few months, I'm certain that I would also work well with Dr. Min Xu on his Deep Learning applications in cryo-electron tomography, specifically researching unsupervised and semi-supervised methods for cryo-ET. Each of these professors are pursuing groundbreaking work in their respective areas, and I believe that I can contribute and make an impact in any one of their labs.
