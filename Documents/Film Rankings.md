## Ferris Bueller's Day Off

In my opinion, compared to all the other films on this list, *Ferris Bueller's Day off* was sorely lacking in depth. There was no significant conflict to resolve, no unbeatable odds for the hero protagonist to overcome through their personal development, and no suspense or innate force that made me feel like I needed to continue watching. The two films I didn't include in this list (*Casablanca* and *Taxi Driver*) were undeniably more artistic and revolutionary and rated far higher by film critics. That said, for being released in the 1980s, it was remarkably reminiscent of productions today. The storytelling style and filming techniques seemed to be ahead of their time, and all in all, it wasn't a bad movie. Ferris' adventures were occasionally funny, cleverly executed, and generally fun to experience. While it was far from a masterpiece, I feel that the film accomplished all that it set out to do.

## Blue Velvet

*Blue Velvet* is likely the most artistic or intricate of my top 7 list, and if this were a ranking on the seven most artistic/intricate movies, it likely would have made the top 3. However, this is not the case, and while it possessed an intriguing plot, I personally did not enjoy the experience. This placing will likely be my most controversial placing on this ranking, and I can understand why others may place it far higher. The film possessed a captivating mystery that the protagonist slowly unraveled. There was also a significant conflict that appeared unsolvable. Paired with the many artistic shots in the movie, it seems very good on paper. That being said, the disturbing nature of the multiple scenes overpowered much of the good. In many ways, *Blue Velvet* was a near opposite of *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*. Whereas the latter delivered feel-good entertainment without substance, the former was engaging yet hardly enjoyable.

## Rocky

The *Rocky* franchise persists today, and it all started with the first film in 1976. This story of an unimportant nobody facing one of the greatest boxers in the world was practically guaranteed to be entertaining, but what makes it even more impressive is that its writer was also the lead actor. Story aside, the actual film was very well done, displaying the life of Rocky Balboa and introducing the fight that would be the star focus of the film. My primary criticism of *Rocky* would have to be its lack of complexity. A man is given the chance to fight a heavyweight champion, trains for this fight, and ultimately fights the champion. There weren't many twists or unexpected moments to "shake up" the experience. The boxing match itself was probably the most engaging portion of the piece and granted, it was entertaining. However, like *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*, there seemed to be a lack of intricacy present in the films ahead.

## Bonnie and Clyde

It was only while ranking these films that I realized how great of a production *Bonnie and Clyde* really was. If someone had told me that it was filmed in the 1980s or 1990s, I likely would have believed it. The photography, the acting, and the storyline were all superb. The story of two criminals in love with each other was entertaining to observe. I enjoyed the banter between family members and friends as they drove around the country. Bonnie and Clyde grew more and more famous as the film progressed, yet they always seemed to stay true to themselves and just as entertaining. The unravelling of their plans and "family" was difficult to witness, yet the course of the film made it seem inevitable. Perhaps the best thing about *Bonnie and Clyde* was it's depiction of social villains (criminals) as protagonists and likeable people. This had a social implication as well, portraying the feelings the American people felt toward their government at the time.

## Reality Bites

Filmed in 1994, Reality Bites is the most similar to movies found today. It follows the life of Lelaina, valedictorian in college, in the professional world. Lelaina starts out with a stable income and stable life until she encounters the wealthy Michael. From there, the relationships with her best friend Troy starts to dissolve. On top of that, she loses her job, leading to a desperate search for another. This, in turn, leads to arguments with friends, more broken relationships, and a downward spiral for Lelaina's entire world. This story did not possess the photography of *Rocky*, the artistry of *Blue Velvet*, or even the feel-good nature of *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*. What *Reality Bites* did possess was a heartfelt story that was very relatable paired with expert acting. If I am being entirely honest, this was one of the only movies in our roster that seemed like a quote on quote "normal" movie, with the exception of *Rocky*, which may have influenced my judgement.

## Pulp Fiction

*Pulp Fiction* was a wild ride to be sure. The acting was superb, the transitions and filming style were unconventional and effective, and the story was nothing if not captivating. It described best as "organized chaos." What I appreciated most about the production was the collection of many phenomenal stories all mashed up into one large piece. Vincent and Jules' adventures alone could have been the basis for a phenomenal movie, but Quentin Tarantino did not stop there. There was also Mia's date with Vincent, Butch's fighting and saving of Marsellus Wallace, and the robbery by Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. While having many different stories seems like it should take away from each, the smooth transitions and connections between each only add to the experience. *Pulp Fiction* is also noted for having extremely quotable lines and memorable characters. More than that, every minute of the film was engaging or entertaining. Tarantino truly outdid himself with this independent piece.

## Jaws

All of the films up to this point are great works in their own right, and I am grateful for the chance to see each. Whether it was phenomenal acting, riveting imagery, or stellar storytelling, these films have all had their own signature features that make them great. Jaws was an amazing movie all around, but it certainly had one feature that put it on top: building anticipation. Unlike most action-filled thriller movies where a protagonist encounters a monster or villain many times throughout a movie, Jaws carefully avoided direct confrontation with the monster until the last possible minute. By doing this, an air of suspense thickened with every issue. First with the girl being killed at the beginning. Next with the child near the beach. After that, the suspension is slowly built more and more by Hooper's findings, the attempts of the fishermen to catch the shark, Quint's effort to hunt the best, and Chief Brodie's slow unraveling. It was interesting to find that one major reason the shark is rarely shown throughout the film is because of fears that the shark mechanism would look unrealistic. That suggests that this brilliant move to build suspension may have been a complete accident. Because of this suspenseful nature of the film, the viewer is left constantly holding onto the edge of their seat, counting down the moments until the final confrontation. It was more than entertaining and made *Jaws* my favorite film of the course.
