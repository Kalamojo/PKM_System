## Long-Term Goals

### Notes

- Two paths:
	- Conducting applied Machine Learning research to benefit customers at scale
	- Developing new methods of learning in PhD with other researchers

### Rough Draft

I can't deny that one of the primary reasons for pursuing admission to this Master's program is to confirm for myself whether I ultimately wish to continue my education with a PhD or immediately obtain an industry research position. In the words of Dr. Salakhutdinov, while academia has more freedom, industry has more immediate impact on users, and the best way to determine which to pursue is to try them for yourself. In any case, I hope to make contributions to the field of Machine Learning as a whole, whether by developing new training algorithms, or by pushing for revolutionary methods to be applied new fields. I currently have my sights set on developing more intelligent loss functions that adapt to environments along with the models they provide guidance to, enabling more robust learning for many ML frameworks.
