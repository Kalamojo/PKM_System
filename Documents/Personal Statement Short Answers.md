## Experiences that Shaped Development

### Notes

- Taking advanced courses early in my education
- Working with those older than me

### Waffle Draft

In my sophomore year of high school, a friend introduced me to an early college program with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and ever since then, my academic and professional experiences have been somewhat unorthodox. I began taking courses with older students, and in doing so, grew accustomed to those environments. Later, I interned with older students, and am currently working with far more experienced individuals. In every setting, I realized that the most

### Rough Draft

Ever since enrolling in an early college program, I've found myself collaborating with individuals that are often older and more experienced than I. The same held true in my professional pursuits, where my early graduation placed me on teams of which I was nearly always the youngest member. Establishing myself as a core member of these groups was challenging at first, purely because of how I viewed myself in comparison to those around me. However, working in these environments ultimately taught me that these differences were essentially meaningless for the sake of achieving goals. When a teammate needed help with a task, no one stopped to double check how old I was before allowing me to give suggestions. I gained an deep appreciation for research and industry settings, where discovery and problem solving are the only real metrics that matter, and I've tried my best to ingrain that philosophy into any collaboration I'm a part of.

## Potential to Contribute to Community

### Notes

- I enjoy this field, and enjoy talking about it with others
	- I have some unique perspectives to share

### Rough Draft

My own academic journey has been somewhat unorthodox, and I've encountered many other unique stories in my academic and professional career so far. Each perspective I encounter has helped to shaped my own, and has solidified my belief that the best environments are ones in which everyone has a chance to share ideas regardless of their background. There are likely many individuals who, if only given the chance to converse with experts, could transform the field of Computer Science and others besides, and their academic or personal background don't always reflect this. I've met with some of them myself, and it always strikes me just how much brilliance this field attracts.  If given the chance, I would love to share my own perspective and journey in this field, and help guide its development as much as I can. There is far too much discovery yet to be had for the exclusion of potential.
